                At Syncano, I'm a Junior Developer Evangelist. This means a lot of things. I build small web applications, go to events, write documentation, and much more. On the left is a weather app. The front-end was developed by a colleague and I developed the backend using the Syncano API.

                Instapaper was my first dive into real world development. It was an amazing opportunity because I was able to write production code for my first software development job. At Instapaper, I redid the browse section front-end and worked on some of the backend api. I developed the algorithm that figured out in which order to display the articles in this section. The goal of the algorithm was to make the user feel as though they would be reading something new in the browse section, all the while feeling consistent. After doing so, I built the internal api for the browse section to be used for our Android and iOS applications.

                I organize Demodays for Tech@nyu. Students from the NYC area come together once a month to show off the projects the've been working on. The last one was a few weeks ago at Venmo. My role is being the host, and putting the event together. This involves finding event space, fundraising, and reaching out to prominent industry leaders to speak at the event. The event averages 80-100 people.
