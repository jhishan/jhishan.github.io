			I'm currently a <b>sophomore at NYU</b>. I study computer science and liberal arts. One of my favorite parts of being at NYU right now is being a part of the organization <a href="http://techatnyu.org/">Tech@nyu</a>. I'm a part of the board and lead an event called <a href="http://demodays.co/">Demodays</a>. It is once a month, about 100 people, and students from the NYC area come together to show off the projects the've been working on. The last one was a few weeks ago, at Tumblr. My role is being the host, and putting the event together. This involves finding event space, raising money for free food, and reaching out to prominent industry leaders to speak at the event.

		Hello world, I'm jhishan. I'm a student at NYU studying CS. I'm interested in all things internet and social. I love people and I love technology and pretty much everything in between. I spend my free time watching documentaries/reading wikipedia, listening to amazing music, riding my bike, taking photographs, and coding as well. In the future, I'd like to start my own tech-related venture or join a friend in their own. I'm excited to see what happens.
